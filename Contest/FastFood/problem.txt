tag:		DP
problem:	Given n-pos shops,find m store point to make the minium distance
solution:	let dp[i][j] be the 0...i and with j-store-points,then we have 
to cacl all the possibilities that j has with i.Now let's think about the j 
store point if j-1 store point is sloved and stored.
		There are multi-conditions that j might take,if from 0...i all 
belong to j,or if 1...i belong to j, ... ,or if i...i belong to j,or none
belong to j.Think about all the possibilities,we have this equotion"
			dp[i][j]=min(0<=k<=i){dp[k][j-1]+cost[k][i]}
